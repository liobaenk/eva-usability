# Eva Usability Study

Corpus: 2 behavioural studies (laboratory: ASC vs. NC, longitudinal training with 2 timepoints: ASC vs. NC) -- Aim: Assess the usability and training effects of EVA (Social Cognition Training tool, EMOTISK)

## Description
This project aimed at investigating the Usability and first preliminary effectiveness of a tablet-based training app (title: 'Emotion Verstehen und Ausdrücken' - EVA) for Social Cognition, with a special focus on emotion recognition. This app was developed as an updated version of S.C.O.T.T (Social Cognition Training Tool), developed by the Dziobek Lab. The development of EVA was funded by the BMBF as part of a multisite project 'EMOTISK' (https://www.interaktive-technologien.de/projekte/emotisk).

EVA is developed to aid persons who experience impairment in social interactions, specifically the ones on the autism spectrum, to advance in emotion recognition (face, voice, daily stereotypical interactions) and socio-cognitive ability.
